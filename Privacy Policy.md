Privacy Policy

Last Updated November 12, 2022

I, Mbavhalelo Neron Maano, designed this app in a way that respects your right to privacy.  This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected and utilized by this game, and how you can exercise your privacy rights.  This Privacy Policy applies to personal information that I collect through mobile, PC and console Games, and at my Website.

If after reading this you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or your personal information, please send an email to prurientes1@gmail.com and I will try to address it.

What personal information does this game collect and why?

The personal information that this game may collect about you through the Services broadly falls into the following categories:  When you play this game or visit my website, the game and website may collect certain information automatically from your device; this information may be considered personal information under applicable data protection laws.  Also from time to time, you may send personal information voluntarily, for example when you email for support. This information is stored in my partner's servers, and visible to me in anonymous, aggregated or pseudonymized form which does not focus on you individually.

Specifically, this may include information like your device type, unique device identification numbers, broad geographic location (e.g. country derived from IP address) and technical information such as crash reporting.  In addition, this game may collect information about your interactions with it, such as how long you play for, or whether you have encountered any technical glitches.

This type of anonymized data enables me as a software developer to figure out how players use this game, so that I can make improvements to the game over time, such as fixing bugs or identifying areas of the game which are too difficult.

In addition, in some of my free to play games I have also partnered with mobile advertising networks.  Each of these companies collect some pseudonymized usage data from players, such as whether or not a player finishes watching an ad all the way through, or whether or not a user clicks on an ad.

Information that I collect automatically on my website

My website uses cookies and similar tracking technology (collectively, “Cookies”) to collect and use personal information about you. When you visit my website, the information my website collects automatically may include information like your IP address, device or browser type, unique device identification numbers, or broad geographic location (e.g. country).  This information is stored in my partner's hosting servers, and visible to me in anonymous, aggregated or pseudonymized form which does not focus on you individually.

Viewing this information enables me to better understand the people who visit my website, where they come from, and what content is of interest to them so I can improve the quality and relevance of my website to visitors.

For information about exercising your data rights with my 3rd party partners, please contact me at prurientes1@gmail.com and I will give you thier contact information on demand.

Information that you provide voluntarily for authentication

Some of my games offer Platform Services which enable you to connect to other users or back up your save file online.  For example, you might log into iCloud on an iOS device, or Google Play Games Services on an Android device.  In such cases, I may get access to some information such as your Username or Gamertag. In such cases, I treat such information in accordance to the privacy mandates of the Platform Service, and of this Privacy Policy.

For information about exercising your data rights with my 3rd party partners, please contact the relevent Platform providers.

Information that you provide voluntarily for communication

Certain other parts of my Services may ask you to provide personal information voluntarily.  For example, when you sign up for our mailing list, I may ask you to provide your name and email address, or receive that information when you send a support email.  The personal information that you are asked to provide, and the reasons why you are asked to provide it, will be made clear to you at the point I ask you to provide it.

At any time you wish to access, correct, update or request deletion of your personal information, you may do so.

Legal basis for processing personal information

My legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which I collect it.

However, I will normally collect personal information from you only (i) where I need the personal information to perform a contract with you, (ii) where the processing is in my legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights, or (iii) where I have your consent to do so.

If I ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contact with you, I will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).

I will process your information for the purposes of operating my website, games and other services and communicating with you as necessary for those purposes and in my legitimate commercial interests, for instance, when responding to your queries, undertaking marketing activities, improving my games, website and other services or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities.

Who do I share your personal information with?

Generally speaking, I am in the business of making games, not sharing or selling data. Therefore, whatever data you share with me is used strictly for the purposes of improving my services, and for staying in touch with players of my games and website visitors.

However, I may disclose your personal information to the following categories of recipients:

    to third party services providers and partners who provide data processing services to my products, or who otherwise process personal information for purposes that are described in this Privacy Policy.

    to any competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government agency, court or other third party where we believe disclosure is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to exercise, establish or defend my legal rights, or (iii) to protect your vital interests or those of any other person;

    to a potential or actual buyer (and its agents and advisers) in connection with any proposed or actual purchase, merger or acquisition of any part of my business, provided that I inform the buyer they must use your personal information only for the purposes disclosed in this Privacy Policy.

How I keep your personal information secure?

I use appropriate technical and organisational measures designed to protect the personal information that I collect and process about you.  The measures I use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information.

Whenever possible the information I collect is anonymized, hashed, pseudonymized, or otherwise obscured, so that the information viewed is not linked to any identifiable individual by the person viewing it.

I limit access to all personal information, including such pseudonymized information, to individuals within our team who require that access (for example, tech support personnel, or analytics staff) and who have been trained on our privacy policies.

International data transfers

Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are a resident.  These countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country.

Some servers that I use are located around the world, and my third party service providers and partners operate around the world. This means that when my products collect your personal information it may be processed in any of these countries.

However, I have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Data retention

I retain personal information my products collect from you where I have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).

When I have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, I will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then I will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

Children

My services are intended for anyone above the age of 13 and I do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children.

If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided information without their consent, he or she should contact me at prurientes1@gmail.com. I will delete such information within a reasonable period of time.

Your Data Subject Rights (DSRs)

I respond to all requests I receive from individuals wishing to exercise their Data Subject Rights (DSRs) in accordance with applicable data protection laws.  When applicable, I will fulfil your requests myself. In the case of data which I do not directly maintain or store, I will refer you to the appropriate partner to fulfill your request.

You have the following Data Subject Rights:

    If you wish to access, correct, update or request deletion of your personal information, you can do so at any time by by contacting me at prurientes1@gmail.com.

    In addition, you can object to processing of your personal information, ask me to restrict processing of your personal information or request portability of your personal information. Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting me using the contact details provided in this privacy policy.

    You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications I send to you at any time.  You can exercise this right by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing e-mails I send you.

    Similarly, if I have collected and processed your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time.  Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing I conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

    You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about my collection and use of your personal information.  For more information, please contact your local data protection authority.

Updates to this Privacy Policy

I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in response to changing legal, technical or business developments. When I update this Privacy Policy, I will take appropriate measures to inform you, consistent with the significance of the changes I make.
